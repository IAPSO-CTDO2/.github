#   IAPSO CTDO<sub>2</sub> Working Group

Welcome to the **IAPSO CTDO<sub>2</sub>** working group!
This international community was started in 2024 with the intention of assembling experts in CTD data processing routines to assess methods and algorithms, present findings, teach others, and help troubleshoot common problems.

* **C**onductivity
* **T**emperature
* **D**epth (or pressure)
* **O<sub>2</sub>** or oxygen

Combined, these properties define seawater density and a number of other derived variables which are essential to science in marine and brackish environments.

##  How to contribute
The IAPSO CTDO<sub>2</sub> is an open community and encourages anyone with an interest in CTDO<sub>2</sub> to participate.

To get started with the community, consider [introducing yourself here](https://github.com/orgs/IAPSO-CTDO2/discussions/1).

We have a number of ongoing efforts and subgroups outlined below.
If any of them appear interesting, consider reaching out to the individuals involved on each project.

##  Ongoing efforts

* Community polls
* CTDO<sub>2</sub> processing routine intercomparison
* CTDO<sub>2</sub> step settings and order investigation
* Oxygen methodology and international processing comparisons
* Introduction to Github for CTDO<sub>2</sub> data purposes

##  Meetings
This workgroup meets depending on group availability, usually determined at the end of the previous meeting.
To see when the next discussion will be, see our meeting notes.
